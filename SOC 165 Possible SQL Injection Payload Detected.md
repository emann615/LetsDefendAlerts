</br>
</br>

Looking at the Monitoring page, I see an alert was triggered because a possible SQL injection payload was detected. I take ownership of the alert and create a case, so I cant start the playbook.

## Collect Data

</br>
</br>

I searched the Endpoint Security page to see if either of the IP addresses are owned by the internal network. The destination IP address (172.16.17.18) is associated with WebServer1001. The source IP address (167.99.169.17) did not return any results, indicating that it is outside the network.

</br>
</br>

I searched 167.99.169.17 in AbuseIPDB to identify the owner and IP address reputation. It shows that the ISP is DigitalOcean LLC. The IP addresss has been reported 15,152 times, but the Confidence of Abuse is 0%.

</br>
</br>

Next, I searched 167.99.169.17 in Cisco Talos IP & Domain Reputation Center. It identifies the IP reputation as Neutral.

</br>
</br>

Since Abuse IPDB and Cisco Talos were inconclusive, I decided to check VirusTotal. It shows that 9 vendors identified the IP address as malicious.

</br>
</br>

I still wanted a second source to confirm that the IP is malicious, so I also checked Hybrid Analysis. The results show that the IP address is malicious with a Threat Score of 100/100.

## Examine HTTP Traffic

</br>
</br>

I used a URL decoder to decode and examine the URL in the HTTP Request. The decoded URL indicates **SQL injection** is the attack method.
* Decoded URL: https://172.16.17.18/search/?q=" OR 1 = 1 -- -

## Check If It Is a Planned Test

<img src="https://github.com/emann615/LetsDefendAlerts/assets/117882385/fdee709c-36dd-4f65-b519-d213e196dba9" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</br>
</br>

I searched the source IP address, destination Ip address, and hostname on the Email Security page. No results were populated, so their is no indication that this was a planned test. There is also no indication that an attack simulation product was used.

## What is the Direction of Traffic?

<img src="https://github.com/emann615/LetsDefendAlerts/assets/117882385/30c8f9d2-d238-432f-9503-014d7a02e9d5" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</br>
</br>

Based on the investigation so far, I know the source IP address is from the internet, and the destination IP address is from the internal network. Therefore, the direction of traffic is **Internet -> Company Network**.

## Check Whether the Attack Was Successful

</br>
</br>

I checked the Log Managment page to see if there was any indication that the attack was successful. I searched the source IP address (167.99.169.17) and found multiple log entries.

<img src="https://github.com/emann615/LetsDefendAlerts/assets/117882385/bc3e0019-5e1c-45c8-ae19-1c66b2200a17" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</br>
</br>

Based on the raw logs, it looks like there were multiple HTTP requests sent attempting SQL injection. All of the request resulted in a status code of 500 and a response size of 948.

</br>
</br>

I decoded the URLs found in each HTTP requests. The decoded URLs show that multiple SQLi medthods were attempted.

# Was the Attack Successful?

</br>
</br>

Since mulitple there were multiple SQLi attempts using different methods that resulted in a consistent response size of 948, this indicates that that the attack was not successful.

I laso checked the command history for WebServer1001 on the Endpoint Security page. The command history shows no indication that the attack was successful.

## Add Artifacts

## Do You Need Tier 2 Escalation?

</br>
</br>

Since the attack the attack was not successful, and it did not originate from the internal network, there is no need to escalate.
