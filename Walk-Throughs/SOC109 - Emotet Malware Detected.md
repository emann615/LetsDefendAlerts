# EventID 85 - SOC109 - Emotet Malware Detected

## Alert

The Monitoring page shows that this alert was triggered because a Emotet malware was detected. I took ownership of the alert, created a case, and started the playbook.

## Define Threat Indicator

On the Log Management page, I searched the source IP address 172.16.17.45. Multiple entries were returned, but none of them correspond to the time of the alert.

## Check if the malware is quarantined/cleaned

The alert shows that Device Action is Cleaned, indicating that the malware was cleaned.

## Analyze Malware

I searched the MD5 hash for the 1word.doc file in VirusTotal. The results show that 45 out of 61 vendors flagged the file as malicious, and it is identified as a trojan.

Next, I searched the MD5 has in Hybrid Analysis. The file was identified as malicious with a Threat Score 100/100.

I also downloaded the file to a sandbox environment and analyzed it with Any Run. Malicious activity was identified. The file creates two processes, WINWORD.EXE and powershell.exe. The powershell.exe process was identified as a malicious, and it creates connections to multiple IP addresses.

## Check If Someone Requested the C2

On the Log Managment page, I could find no evidence that connection was made to any of the possible C2 addresses.

I Also checked the process history for the RichardPRD machine on the Endpoint Security page. There is no evidence of powershell.exe process on the machine.

These findings combined with the fact that the malware was cleaned, indicates that there was no request made to the C2 address.

## Analysts Note

The 1word.doc file is a malicious document that uses PowerShell to connect to the internet. The file was cleaned before execution, so the attack was not successful.
