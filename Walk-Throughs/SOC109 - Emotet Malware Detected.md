I also downloaded the file to a sandbox environment and analyzed it with Any Run. Malicious activity was identified. The file creates two processes, WINWORD.EXE and powershell.exe. The powershell.exe process was identified as a malicious, and it creates connections to multiple IP addresses.

## Check If Someone Requested the C2

On the Log Managment page, I could find no evidence that connection was made to any of the possible C2 addresses.

I Also checked the process history for the RichardPRD machine on the Endpoint Security page. There is no evidence of powershell.exe process on the machine.

These findings combined with the fact that the malware was cleaned, indicates that there was no request made to the C2 address.
