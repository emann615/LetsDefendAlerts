</br>
</br>

There are no attachements, but there is a URL (http://nuangaybantiep.xyz) in the body of the email.

</br>
</br>

I analyzed the URL in VirusTotal. Only 1/89 vendors flagged the URL as malicious.

</br>
</br>

I also took a look at the Joe Snadbox analysis report for the URL. The report identifies the URL as suspicious. The URL is currently not reachable, but appears to have previously been used to spread a trojan.

</br>

## Check If Someone Opened the Malicios File/URL?

I went to the Log Management page and searched for the URL (http://nuangaybantiep.xyz). One log entry was returned with a source IP address of 172.16.17.88 and a destination IP address of 192.64.119.190.

</br>
</br>

The raw data for the log shows the same URL I found in the email.

</br>
</br>

On the Endpoint Security page, I searched the source IP address from the log entry. It belongs to the MarkPRD device.

</br>
</br>

Base on this information, the URL was accessed from the MarkPRD device.

## Containment

I contained the device to prevent the spread of the attack.
